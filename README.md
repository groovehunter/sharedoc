sharedoc
========

sharedoc aims to be a drupal installation profile for a single or a few persons structuring their personal documents and notes and sharing with a small group of people

So a few points of functionality are worth mention:

* documents with metadata, files, images resizable, attachements and so on
* access control, one time links for new people which are not registered yet
* some tagging, categorizing, support for semantic 



* bulk upload

* date field


== plans maybe 

* hierarchical select
